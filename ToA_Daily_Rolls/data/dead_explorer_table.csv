d20,Remains
1,"The bloated corpse of a dead halfling, riddled with tiny arrows and dangling from a tree vine. (The halfling trespassed on grung sacred ground, and the corpse was hung here as a warning.)"
2,"The bones of an unarmored humanoid, lashed to a tree by vines. (This explorer was captured by Batiri goblins, doused in honey, and left to be devoured by hungry insects.)"
3,"The crushed remains of an unarmored dwarf, showing signs that she was stomped to death by a rampaging dinosaur."
4,"The gnawed and charred bones of a humanoid. (This unfortunate was murdered and cannibalized by his starving, fever-crazed companions.)"
5,"The mangled body of a half-elf, seemingly bludgeoned to death. (She was dropped from high altitude by pterafolk.)"
6,"The scattered bones of a dwarf, torn to pieces before being devoured. (A hunting pack of velociraptors did the dwarf in.)"
7,"The swollen, purple corpse of an elf, dead only a few days ago from the bite of a poisonous snake."
8,A fresh human corpse stuffed into a hollow tree. (Girallons plan to return and devour it later.)
9,"The skeleton of a humanoid seated on a folding camp stool, clutching a knife and fork in its bony hands."
10,"The desiccated husk of a gnome, cocooned in giant spider webs."
11,"The body of a human - from the waist up. Signs show that the explorer crawled a considerable distance after being bitten in half by a tyrannosaurus. (A Flaming Fist charter found on the corpse identifies it as Lord Onovan IV, of the Dales.)"
12,A charred elf's skeleton inside a charred constrictor snake's skeleton. (Both were killed by a lightning bolt spell.)
13,"The rotting body of a giant frog with the blade of a shortsword poking out its back. (If the frog is cut open, the partially digested body of a halfling is found inside.)"
14,"A tabaxi spread-eagled on the ground, but with its limbs and head severed from its torso and crudely stitched back on in the wrong arrangement."
15,A half-orc spiked to an enormous tree by the broken-off horn of a triceratops.
16,"A gnome, spitted over a burned-out fire pit and thoroughly overcooked, but not eaten. (Goblin weapons and tools are scattered around amid velociraptor tracks.)"
17,"A headless humanoid, hung upside down from a tree and with six Batiri goblin spears thrust symmetrically through the body. (It was a Red Wizard, judging by the robes. The head is nowhere to be found.)"
18,"An elf, balanced on a tree branch 40 feet above the ground, arms and legs dangling downward. (A note pressed between the body and the branch explains that the elf climbed the tree to get away from a prowling allosaurus and was too terrified to come down.)"
19,"The moldering remains of a human wearing a Flaming Fist-style helmet, his legs broken. (He succumbed to a faerie dragon's euphoria breath weapon and stepped off a cliff. A companion tried to carry him back to Fort Beluarian, but the warrior died en route.)"
20,A dwarf with six large holes piercing her armor and chest. (A stegosaurus caught her squarely with a swipe of its tail.)
